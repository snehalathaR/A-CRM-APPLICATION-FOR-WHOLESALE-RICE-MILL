# Rice Mill CRM Application

The **Rice Mill CRM Application** is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline and simplify operations in a wholesale rice mill. This application leverages Salesforce's powerful CRM capabilities to enhance customer experiences, optimize store operations, and improve overall efficiency in the rice mill factory.

## Features and Functionality

- **Reporting and Dashboards**: 
  - Generate detailed reports and analytics on daily rice production, sales, total income, and customer purchases.
  - View easily understandable data to assist owners in resource allocation and planning for future development.

- **Rollup Summary Fields**:
  - Summarizes data from child objects to parent objects in a master-detail relationship.
  - Examples: Display the total value of rice supplied from rice details on a related supplier using COUNT, SUM, MIN, and MAX functions.

- **Cross-Object Formula Fields**:
  - Reference fields from another object to calculate and display values.
  - Example: Calculate the total amount to be paid by multiplying the number of rice units by the price per kilogram.

- **Validation Rules**:
  - Ensure data integrity by applying validation rules, including error messages when invalid data is entered.
  - Example: An `ISBLANK` formula is used to validate fields, ensuring that mandatory fields are not left blank.

- **Permission Sets and Roles**:
  - Set up Organization-Wide Defaults (OWD) to restrict data access based on roles.
  - Roles include Owner, Employer, and Worker, with varying levels of access to records. 
  - Example: The Owner can view all records, the Employer can view Worker records, and Workers have limited access.
